Clargs
=======

Clargs is a C++17 library for parsing command-line arguments. It's meant to accommodate my personal quirks and concerns and as such may not be as effective for general use.  There are three or so things I do at the start of every program I write and this library is designed to cook that process down to a minimum of five lines of code.  My current thinking is to develop it as a wrapper for another library, but I may swing back later and build my own parser from scratch, depending on how it goes.

End Goal: When I start a new project, I want to jump past all the argparsing boilerplate and get right to work coding the specific thing I want the app to do.
